## Core Features:

- Generate Quote: Use AI to generate motivational, love, life, or sad quotes.
- Category Selector: Allow users to select a category for quote generation (motivational, love, life, or sad).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated purple (#9400D3) for a bold and modern feel, hinting at creativity and inspiration.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA), a desaturated version of the primary color, providing a soft backdrop that complements the purple.
- Accent color: Deep pink (#FF1493), analogous to purple but with distinct brightness and saturation, used for highlighting key interactive elements.
- Font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a geometric, contemporary feel suitable for quotes and UI elements.
- Use simple, clean icons that reflect each quote category. Motivational icons can be sunrise gradients, hearts for love, roads for life, and raindrops for sadness.
- Implement a modern layout with vibrant gradients and soft shadows to enhance the visual appeal.
- Incorporate smooth animations for transitions and interactions, like the fade-in of the quote or the category selection.
